# A2UI (Agent to UI) Protocol

This repository contains the specification for the A2UI protocol, a JSONL-based, streaming UI protocol designed to be easily generated by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Overview

The A2UI protocol enables a server to stream a platform-agnostic, abstract UI definition to a client, which then renders it progressively using a native widget set. The core design principles are:

- **LLM-Friendly**: The protocol uses a simple, declarative, and flat structure that is easy for LLMs to generate.
- **Progressive Rendering**: The UI is streamed as a series of JSONL messages, allowing the client to render the UI as it arrives, improving perceived performance.
- **Platform-Agnostic**: The protocol defines an abstract component tree, and the client is responsible for mapping these abstract components to its native widget implementations.
- **Separation of Concerns**: The protocol separates the UI structure (components), the application state (data model), and the client-side widget rendering.

## Repository Layout

The repository is structured as follows:

- `docs/`: This directory contains the formal specification for the A2UI protocol (`docs/a2ui_protocol.md`) and related design documents and proposals.
- `specification/json/`: This directory contains the JSON schema files used to validate A2UI protocol messages and client event messages.
